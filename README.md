### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**EthanMc246/EthanMc246** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on landing a Front-end developer internship.
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning several coding languages.
- ğŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with landing a front-end development job.
- I have attended Nucamp's coding bootcamp. I have learned many skills such as: HTML, CSS, Javascript, Python, React, React Native, SQL, NodeJS, MongoDB, Git, NPM, ect. I have learned a lot, but I know there is still much for me to learn and I look forward to doing so.
